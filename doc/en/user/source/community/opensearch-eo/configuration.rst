Configuring the OpenSearch module
=================================

The OpenSearch module needs to know upon which database perform the searches.

Follow these steps:

* Setup a standard PostGIS database pointing to the database and schema created above
  from the SQL file. Note down the full name of the store (e.g. ``test:metadata`` where ``test``
  is the workspace and ``metadata`` is the store name). 
  Besides filling the connection parameters, remember to set "expose primary keys" to true.
* Create a new store of type "JDBC based OpenSearch store" and configure the fully qualified name
  of the basic PostGIS store in its "store" parameter.

* Go into the "OS-EO" service configuration page and configure the "OpenSearch" store

Advanced: adding product classes
--------------------------------

The design of the OpenSearch module is "data driven", meaning that one can materialize new
search properties by just adding new columns to the product and collection tables.

In particular, both tables have a "prefix based" convention linking the properties to their
respective product types, and the engine will advertise for a particular product only 
the properties relevant to it. For example, in an optical product, the properties starting
with "opt" will be listed, but not those starting with "sar".

Here is a table of the product classes known out of the box:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Prefix
     - Namespace
     - Description
   * - eop_generic
     - eop
     - http://www.opengis.net/eop/2.1
     - Base properties shared among all EO products. Never remove this class.
   * - optical
     - opt
     - http://www.opengis.net/opt/2.1
     - Optical products properties
   * - radar
     - sar
     - http://www.opengis.net/sar/2.1
     - Radar products properties
   * - Altimetric
     - alt
     - http://www.opengis.net/alt/2.1
     - Altimetric products properties
   * - Atmospheric
     - atm
     - http://www.opengis.net/atm/2.1
     - Atmospheric products properties
   * - Limb
     - lmb
     - http://www.opengis.net/lmb/2.1
     - Limb products properties
   * - ssp
     - ssp
     - http://www.opengis.net/ssp/2.1
     - SSP products properties

The various properties have different usages:

* The *name* is used in the collection to define the type of sensor (eoSensorType column)
* The *prefix* is used in the product table as a prefix to column name in order to associate
  them to a particular product type, shows up as-is in the JSON representations of the REST API,
  as well as the prefix in XML outputs
* The *namespace* is used in XML output, along with the prefix (e.g., ``xmlns:opt="http://www.opengis.net/opt/2.1"``)


It is possible to add new product classes as well as changing the build-in ones, but care should
be taken to keep product classes and database aligned. After any change to the database structure
remember to "reset" the GeoServer configuration to make it re-scan the table structures.

GeoJSON output templates
------------------------

The module supports GeoJSON encoding of collections and products according to the  
<OGC OpenSearch-EO GeoJSON(-LD) Response Encoding Standard`https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-047r1/17-047r1.html`>_.

Give the structure required in output, it's not possible to use the simple features GeoJSON encoders.
The module is instead using two dedicated :ref:`features templates <community_wfstemplating>`,
that the user can customize to match the database structure.

The default templates are part of the GeoServer distribution, and are automatically copied to the
data directory on startup, to allow for customization:

* `$GEOSERER_DATA_DIR/templates/os-eo/products.json` is the `products template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/src/community/oseo/oseo-service/src/main/resources/org/geoserver/opensearch/eo/products.json>`_
* `$GEOSERER_DATA_DIR/templates/os-eo/collections.json` is the `collections template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/src/community/oseo/oseo-service/src/main/resources/org/geoserver/opensearch/eo/collections.json>`_

The default templates work against the `default PostGIS database structure <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/src/community/oseo/oseo-core/src/test/resources/postgis.sql>`_ and
can be customized to include new properties to follow eventual database modifications.

Specifically for products, collection specific templates can also be provided, which would contain
directives and mappings unique to that collection.
A collection specific template can be placed in the same templates directory as above, 
using the naming convention ``products-<COLLECTION_ID>.json``, where
``<COLLECTION_ID>`` is the collection identifier. 
For example, if the collection is named ``SENTINEL2`` a products template specific for it will
be named ``products-SENTINEL2.json``.

More information about writing templates can be found in the :ref:`templates guide <oseotemplates>`.
